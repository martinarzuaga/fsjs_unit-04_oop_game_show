This project is about Guessing a Phrase, a.k.a "Phrase Hunter".

It's made with JavaScript Vanila. The CSS and the HTML is provided by Treehouse.

# How it works
1. A random and hidden phrase is choosen randomly for the app.
2. The player will try to guess the phrase with his/her keyboard.
3. Once a key is pressed, the program compares that letter with the random phrase ones. If the letter is in the phrase, the gameboard displays the choosen letters on the screen.
4. A player continues to select letters until they guess the phrase (and win), or make five incorrect guesses (and lose).
5. If the player completes the phrase before they run out of guesses, a winning screen appears. If the player guesses incorrectly five times, a losing screen appears.
6. A player can guess a letter only once. After theyâ€™ve guessed a letter, the program will disable that letter on the onscreen keyboard.
